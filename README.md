Friendship can be so complex...
It leaves some discouraged, others very happy...
It's feeding the weak
it's the kingdom of the strong

make us make mistakes
The weak let themselves go down
The strong always raise their heads
the like that assume them

Without thinking we conquered
the general world
and we build our little place
letting each little star shine

Little stars...
Sweet, sensitive, cold, tender...
But always present anywhere
The owners of friendship...

More than an outstretched hand
more than a beautiful smile
more than the joy of sharing
more than dreaming the same dreams
or hurt the same pains
much more than the silence that speaks
or the silent voice, to hear
yeah, friendship, food
that satisfies our soul
and it is offered to us by someone
who believes in us.
